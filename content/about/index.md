Hello! I'm Aveena, a software engineer based in San Francisco, California.

I am a graduate student from Stony Brook University pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science. I have 3 years of work experience as Software Engineer at Nomura.

I have experience building distributed and reliable micro-services, backend services, big data analytics and ML models. My interest areas are distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, machine learning and data engineering. I am always eager to learn new technolgies and intergrate them into existing tech-stack.
